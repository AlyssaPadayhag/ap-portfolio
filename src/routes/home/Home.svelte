    <h1>Hi There!</h1>
    <p>I am a full stack web developer~</p>
    <br>
    <p>My interest in web dev first started when I was a young girl, in the MySpace era, where we can modify our page
        to make it look how we want.
    </p>
    <p>I also grew up with four boys and we all had a great interest in video games, which led me to my curiosity
        of how computers and software work.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>Now here I am, always learning and always looking for the next challenge~</p>
